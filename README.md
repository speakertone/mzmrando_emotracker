# Metroid: Zero Mission Randomizer Map Tracker Pack

A map and item tracker for the [Metroid: Zero Mission Item Randomizer](https://forum.metroidconstruction.com/index.php/topic,4559.0.html).
This pack must be used with [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net).

## Notes

- **Made for MZMR v1.4.0.** I have yet to try out the recently released v1.5.0, but I plan to update this pack to match it as soon as I can.
- **Includes full autotracking capabilities.** There are only three settings which must be set manually: *Prevent softlocks*, *Infinite bomb jump*, and *Wall jumping*.
- **Switch difficulty at any time.** There is only one pack variant, and you can toggle your difficulty from *Easy/Normal* to *Hard* in the settings menu. This way, if you accidentally start with the wrong difficulty setting, you can easily change it without losing everything you've already tracked.
- **Prevent softlocks.** This setting is enabled by default and hides any reachable locations that could result in a softlock. Sometimes no locations will appear reachable, at which point you should toggle *Prevent softlocks* and see what changes (usually you simply need to head to Norfair). When *Prevent softlocks* is off, all potential softlocks will be marked as inspectable (blue).
- Any locations that require you to Infinite Bomb Jump or Hellrun are marked as sequence breaks (yellow).
